## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start both servers (backend proxy + frontend):
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

Or start them separately:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend proxy server (Python Flask on port 3002)
npm run server
# or: python3 server.py

# Terminal 2: Frontend dev server (port 3000)
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

**Important**: The backend proxy server (Python Flask on port 3002) is required to bypass CORS restrictions. Without it, scraping will fail due to browser security policies.

## Usage

1. **Initial Setup**: When you first open the dashboard, click "Scrape Now" to start collecting data.

2. **Scraping**: Click the "Scrape Now" button to fetch new e-invoicing content from the BOSA website.

3. **Viewing Data**: 
   - Browse recent posts in the main list
   - Click on any post to view full details
   - Use search and date filters to find specific content

4. **Exporting**: 
   - Click "Download Excel" to download all data
   - Use "Export Filtered" to download filtered results

5. **Analytics**: View publication frequency charts and statistics in the dashboard.

## Technical Details

### Storage
- Uses `window.storage` API (with localStorage fallback)
- Data stored as base64-encoded Excel files
- Also maintains JSON format for quick access

### CORS Handling
The application includes a **Python Flask backend proxy server** that handles all web scraping requests server-side, completely bypassing CORS restrictions.

**Architecture:**
- Frontend (React) runs on port 3000
- Backend proxy (Python Flask) runs on port 3002
- All scraping requests go through the backend proxy
- No CORS issues since server-to-server requests don't have CORS restrictions

**Python Dependencies:**
- Flask - Web framework
- flask-cors - CORS handling
- requests - HTTP client for scraping

**Fallback Options:**
- If backend proxy is unavailable, tries direct fetch
- Falls back to external CORS proxies as last resort

### Excel Structure
- Column A: Publication Date
- Column B: Post URL
- Column C: Post Title
- Column D: Content Summary/Excerpt
- Column E: Scrape Timestamp
- Column F: Status (New/Existing)

## Dependencies

- **React** - UI framework
- **SheetJS (xlsx)** - Excel file handling
- **Recharts** - Data visualization
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
